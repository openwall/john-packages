[Openwall's](https://openwall.com/) John the Ripper (JtR) is a fast password cracker, currently available for many
flavors of Unix and for Windows. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password
hash types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are Windows LM hashes, various macOS
password hashes, as well as many non-hashes such as SSH private keys, encrypted filesystems such as macOS .dmg files and
"sparse bundles", encrypted archives such as ZIP, RAR, and 7z, encrypted document files such as PDF and Microsoft
Office's, plus lots of other hashes and ciphers.

> Some relevant fixes have been committed to the main john repository: office, zip, PDF, ...
>
> IF YOU USE OUTDATED SOFTWARE, FALSE NEGATIVES ARE POSSIBLE AND YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR TIME AND CPU CYCLES.\
> IT IS MANDATORY TO STOP USING PREVIOUS VERSIONS, AS THEY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE ERRORS.

### Continuous Delivery Status

We produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time, following a
pipeline through a "production-like environment".

### Packaging and Application Distribution

[Snap][linkSnapcraftSite] and [Flatpak][linkFlatpakSite] are cool new ways of distributing Linux applications among a
wide range of different distros. They are technologies to deploy applications in a secure, sandboxed and containerized
way.

Both package management systems are designed to provide a consistent way of distributing applications across various
Linux distributions. They allow applications to be packaged with all their dependencies, making installations easier and
reducing compatibility issues.

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image is a read-only template used to execute code in a Docker container. An image
is an immutable file that contains the binaries, configuration files, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files
needed for John the Ripper application to run.

When the Docker user runs an image, it becomes one instance (it becomes a container, in other words, a running instance
of the application).

 Build: cygwin 64-bit x86_64 AVX2 AC OMP OPENCL
 SIMD: AVX2, interleaving: MD4:3 MD5:3 SHA1:1 SHA256:1 SHA512:1
 [...]
```

```powershell
 C:\john-the-ripper\run>john --test --format=SHA512crypt
```

| 📑 **More examples of**
[running John The Ripper on Windows](docs/examples-windows.md#more-examples-of-running-john-the-ripper-on-windows).

The highlights (👀):

- has fallback for CPU[*] and OMP;
- has OpenCL available (GPU driver installation is needed);
- generic crypt(3) format available;
- security feature Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) enabled;
- security feature Data Execution Prevention (DEP) enabled.

[*] John the Ripper runs using the best SIMD instructions available on the host it's running on.

### Windows Deployments

[![Windows Downloads][linkBadgeDownloadWindows]][linkReleases]

Using the instructions above, you can install the released version of `john`, or the bleeding development version, or an
earlier stable version on your system.

### Running a non-OpenMP build on Windows

In some situations a non-OpenMP build may be faster. You can ask to fallback to a non-OpenMP build specifying the value
of OMP_NUM_THREADS in the command-line. You avail the best SIMD instructions at one's disposal without any OpenMP stuff.
E.g.:

```powershell
 PS C:\john-the-ripper\run> set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
 PS C:\john-the-ripper\run> .\john --list=build-info
```

### Accessing OpenCL on Windows

If John the Ripper is not recognizing your GPU card:

- make sure all required GPU drivers are installed;
- restart your PC, if you have just installed the drivers.

## 📂 Snap

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD042 -->

> Delivered using Launchpad \
> Supported architectures: [amd64](# "[ backed by AVX, AVX2, and AVX512BW ]"), [arm64v8](# "[ backed by ASIMD ]"),
> [ppc64le](# "[ backed by Altivec ]"), riscv64, and s390x

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD042 -->

[**A Snap**][linkSnapcraftSite] is a gpg signed squashfs file containing an application together with its dependencies,
and a description of how it should safely be run on your system.

You can install `john` by following the instructions at <https://snapcraft.io/john-the-ripper>. For distributions
without snap pre-installed, users should [enable snap support](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install), then install:

```bash
 sudo snap install john-the-ripper
```

Just dance now:

```bash
 $ john-the-ripper -list=build-info
 [...]
 Build: linux-gnu 64-bit x86_64 AVX2 AC OMP OPENCL
 SIMD: AVX2, interleaving: MD4:3 MD5:3 SHA1:1 SHA256:1 SHA512:1
 Deploy: sandboxed as a Snap app
 [...]
```

You can also run the software using the official `john` alias:

```bash
 john -list=build-info
```

John runs confined under a restrictive security sandbox by default. Nevertheless, you can access and audit any file
located in your home. Below, an usage example:

```bash
 john -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/allTests.in
 john --format=SHA512crypt ~/allTests.in
```

For your convenience, the snap installed on your system contains the file
`/snap/john-the-ripper/current/snap/manifest.yaml` which field `build_url` points to its build log.

The highlights (👀):

- has fallback for CPU[*] and OMP;
- has OpenCL available (GPU driver installation is needed);
- John the Ripper is a "featured software" in the security category on Canonical Snap Store;
- John the Ripper is a software with 4-star (⭐⭐⭐⭐) user reviews on Canonical Snap Store;
- John the Ripper is tagged as safe, confined and auditable software on Canonical Snap Store;
- John the Ripper supports and has a package for all architectures supported by Ubuntu itself.
- also available via the alias **john**, e.g. `john -list=build-info`;
- the latest released version:
  - install from the Snapcraft `stable` channel.
- a development version is also available:
  - install from the Snapcraft `edge` channel.

[*] John the Ripper runs using the best SIMD instructions available on the host it's running on.

```Text
John the Ripper snap package has approximately eight thousand active users [*].
```

[*] 7 Day Active Users: the number of unique users who had at least one session within a 7 day period.

### Enabling Aliases

You are free to pick and set up aliases. To enable the usage of aliases with John the Ripper snap, run
`sudo snap alias john-the-ripper <alias>`. For example:

```bash
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper john-snap
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.dmg2john dmg2john
```

Once enabled, John itself plus the \*2john tools can be invoked using the aliases. In the example, to run John type
`john-snap`.

| 📑 **More examples of**
[enabling alias for John The Ripper snap](docs/examples-snap-alias.md#more-examples-of-enabling-alias-for-john-the-ripper-snap).

### Running a non-OpenMP build

In some situations a non-OpenMP build may be faster. You can ask to fallback to a non-OpenMP build specifying
`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 john <options>` in the command-line. You avail the best SIMD instructions at one's disposal without
any OpenMP stuff. E.g.:

```bash
 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 john --list=build-info
```

### Accessing OpenCL on Snap

As noted at <https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snaps-and-opencl/8509/17>, the use of OpenCL by snaps is a problem. Support
for NVIDIA cards is under development.

As a "general" solution (or in the case of AMD hardware), the user can run john out of the sandbox, unconfined (e.g.,
run `/snap/john-the-ripper/current/bin/john`).

### Snap Deployments

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)][linkSnapcraftJohn]

If you followed the instructions above, you have installed the released version of `john` on your system. If you want to
access the hot and bleeding development version of JtR, you must follow the edge channel. For a clean install:

```bash
 sudo snap install --channel=edge john-the-ripper
```

If you already have JtR installed:

```bash
 sudo snap refresh --channel=edge john-the-ripper
```

If you do so, you will be running the development version available on GitHub.

<p align="right">(<a href="#header">back to top</a>)</p>

```bash
 # Note that root privileges are required for some operations.
 sudo dnf install -y flatpak # or 'yum install', 'apt-get install', etc.
 sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo # flatpak repository
 sudo flatpak install -y flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//24.08 # install the runtime (base "container")
 flatpak --user install --bundle john.flatpak # per-user installation (not system wide)
```

John runs confined under a restrictive security sandbox by default. Nevertheless, you can access and audit any file
located in your home. Below, an usage example:

```bash
 flatpak run com.openwall.John -list=build-info
 flatpak run com.openwall.John -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/allTests.in
 flatpak run com.openwall.John --format=SHA512crypt ~/allTests.in
```

The highlights (👀):

## Packages Checksums

> Released packages checksums computed by Build Servers

File verification is the process of using an algorithm for verifying the integrity of a computer file. A popular
approach is to store checksums (hashes) of files, also known as message digests, for later comparison. All john packages
checksums (hashes) are computed by the CI servers.

By accessing the build logs for each release on GitHub releases you can view the hashes of all relevant files.

You can also go to <https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/attestations> for a list of our named artifacts along with
their digest.

<p align="right">(<a href="#header">back to top</a>)</p>

## ⚠ Security

Please inspect all packages prior to running any of them to ensure safety. We already know they're safe, but you should
verify the security and contents of any binary from the internet you are not familiar with.

We take security very seriously.
