[Openwall's](http://openwall.com/) John the Ripper (JtR) is a fast password cracker,
currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows, DOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary
purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash
types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are
Windows LM hashes, plus lots of other hashes and ciphers.

### Package Building Environments

Click on the link to learn more about our packages [Building Environments](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/tree/master/deploy#deployments).

### Packaging and Application Distribution

[Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) and [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) are cool new ways
of distributing Linux applications among a wide range of different distros. They
are technologies to deploy applications in a secure, sandboxed and containerised way.

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image is a read-only template used to execute code in a Docker container. An image is an immutable file that contains the binaries, configuration files, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for John the Ripper application to run.

When the Docker user runs an image, it becomes one instance (it becomes a container, in other words, a running instance of the application).

## Snap

> Delivered using Launchpad [ supports up to AVX512BW ]

[**A Snap**](https://snapcraft.io/) is a gpg signed squashfs file containing an application
together with its dependencies, and a description of how it should safely be run
on your system.

You can install JtR by following the instructions at
[https://snapcraft.io/john-the-ripper](https://snapcraft.io/john-the-ripper).

Terminal-based users should [enable snap support](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install),
then install JtR like this:

```bash
 sudo snap install john-the-ripper
```

John runs confined under a restrictive security sandbox by default. Nevertheless,
you can access and audit any file located in your home. Below, an usage example:

```bash
 john-the-ripper -list=build-info
 john-the-ripper -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/alltests.in
 john-the-ripper -form=SHA512crypt ~/alltests.in
```

For your convenience, the snap installed on your system contains the file
`/snap/john-the-ripper/current/snap/manifest.yaml` which field `build_url`
points to its build log.

The highlights:

- fallback for CPU[*] and OMP;
- prince mode available;
- OpenCL available (GPU driver installation is needed);
- also available via the alias **john**, e.g. `john -list=build-info`;
- the rolling version of John 1.9.0 Jumbo 1+:
  - is available for X86_64, armhf, arm64, ppc64el, i386, riscv64, and s390x;
- the stable John 1.9.0 Jumbo 1:
  - is available for X86_64, armhf, arm64, ppc64el, i386, powerpc, and s390x;
  - has regex mode available;
- a development version:
  - is available for X86_64, arm64, ppc64el, and s390x.

[*] John the Ripper runs using the best SIMD instructions available on the host
it's running on.

```Text
John the Ripper snap package has approximately eight thousand active users [*].
```

[*] 7 Day Active Users: the number of unique users who had at least one session within a 7 day period.

### Running a non-OpenMP build

In some situations a non-OpenMP build may be faster. You can ask to fallback to a
non-OpenMP build specifying `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 john <options>` in the command line.
You avail the best SIMD instructions at one's disposal without any OpenMP stuff. E.g.:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 john --list=build-info
```

### Enabling Aliases

You are free to pick and set up aliases. To enable the usage of aliases with John
the Ripper snap, run `sudo snap alias john-the-ripper <alias>`. For example:

```bash
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper my-john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.dmg2john dmg2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.hccap2john hccap2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.racf2john racf2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.vncpcap2john vncpcap2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.zip2john zip2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.gpg2john gpg2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.keepass2john keepass2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.putty2john putty2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.rar2john rar2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.uaf2john uaf2john
 sudo snap alias john-the-ripper.wpapcap2john wpapcap2john
```

Once enabled, John itself plus the *2john tools can be invoked using the aliases.
In the example, to run John type `my-john`.

### Acessing OpenCL

As noted at https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snaps-and-opencl/8509/17, the use of
OpenCL by snaps is a problem. Support for NVIDIA cards is under development.

As a "general" solution (or in the case of AMD hardware), the user can run john
out of the sandbox, unconfined (e.g., run `/snap/john-the-ripper/current/run/john`).

### Snap Deployments

If you followed the above instructions, you installed the rolling version of John
the Ripper Jumbo 1+ in your system. If you want to access the hot and bleeding
developing version of JtR, you must follow a development channel. For a clean
installation:

```bash
 sudo snap install --channel=edge john-the-ripper
```

If you already has JtR installed:

```bash
 sudo snap refresh --channel=edge john-the-ripper
```

If you do so, you will be running the development version available on GitHub.

## Flatpak

> Delivered using GitLab CI [ supports up to AVX512BW ]

[**Flatpak**](http://flatpak.org//) is a new framework for desktop applications
on Linux, built to be distribution agnostic and allow deployment on any Linux
operating system out there.

Flatpak is available for the [most common Linux distributions](http://flatpak.org/getting.html).

To install JtR download the john.flatpak file and run:

```bash
# Note that root privileges are required for some operations.
 sudo dnf install -y flatpak # or 'yum install', 'apt-get install', etc.
 sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo # flatpak repository
 sudo flatpak install -y flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//22.08 # install the runtime (base "container")
 flatpak --user install --bundle john.flatpak # per-user installation (not system wide)
```

John runs confined under a restrictive security sandbox by default. Nevertheless,
you can access and audit any file located in your home. Below, an usage example:

```bash
 flatpak run com.openwall.John -list=build-info
 flatpak run com.openwall.John -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/alltests.in
 flatpak run com.openwall.John -form=SHA512crypt ~/alltests.in
```

The highlights:

- fallback for CPU[*] and OMP;
- prince mode available.
- the rolling version of John 1.9.0 Jumbo 1+:
  - is available for X86_64;
- the stable John 1.9.0 Jumbo 1:
  - is available for X86_64, arm, aarch64, and i386;
  - has regex mode available;
- a development version:
  - is available for X86_64.

[*] John the Ripper runs using the best SIMD instructions available on the host
it's running on.

### Flatpak Deployments

Using the above instructions you can install the rolling version of John
the Ripper Jumbo 1+, the hot and bleeding version, or any previous stable
version in your system.

John the Ripper single-file flatpak bundle was built and tested on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/claudioandre-br/JtR-CI/pipelines). You can get it
[here](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/releases).

- a development [64bit version](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/releases/tag/jumbo-dev).

### Running a non-OpenMP build on Windows

In some situations a non-OpenMP build may be faster. You can ask to fallback to
a non-OpenMP build specifying the value of OMP_NUM_THREADS in the command line.
You avail the best SIMD instructions at one's disposal without any OpenMP stuff. E.g.:

```powershell
PS C:\john-the-ripper\run> set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
PS C:\john-the-ripper\run> .\john --list=build-info
```

### Running OpenCL

Some adjustments may be necessary to allow John the Ripper detect your GPU
hardware. If you are facing problems, please ask for support.

- That being said, a few advices to anyone facing Windows problems:
  - if `john` is not recognizing your GPU card (and you are sure all required GPU drivers are installed):
    - using the `detect-OpenCL.ps1` script contained in the main folder:
      ```powershell
      # I downloaded and extracted "john" to C:\Users\Me\JtR.
      # Then, opened the `detect-OpenCL.ps1` script and copied the command I need to use;
      #   For security reasons, powershell script execution is disabled by default
      PS C:\Users\Me> cd .\JtR\

      PS C:\Users\Me\JtR> run\john --list=opencl-devices
      Error: No OpenCL-capable platforms were detected by the installed OpenCL driver.

## Docker Image

> Delivered using GitHub Actions [ supports up to AVX512BW ]

For testing and future reference, we have a Docker image of John the Ripper.
To use it:

```bash
 # CPU only formats
 docker run -it ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest <binary id> <john options>

 # To run ztex formats
 docker run --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 ghcr.io/openwall/john:v1.9.0J1 ztex <john options>
```

Run John the Ripper and check if it is working:

```bash
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john # => uses the best SIMD available, tag 'latest' can be ommited
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:rolling # => uses the latest rolling release
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest best # => uses the best SIMD available
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx2-omp -list=build-info
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx512bw -test=0 -format=cpu
```

Run a real cracking session:

```bash
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/alltests.in
 docker run -v "$HOME":/host ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx2 -form=SHA512crypt /host/alltests.in --max-run=300
```

Run a real cracking session, saving the session information on the host:

```bash
 docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/JtR ghcr.io/openwall/john best -form=SHA512crypt /home/JtR/alltests.in --max-run=30
 docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/JtR ghcr.io/openwall/john best -form=SHA512crypt --wordlist --rules /home/JtR/alltests.in --max-run=20
 docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/JtR ghcr.io/openwall/john best -form=SHA512crypt --incrementa:digits /home/JtR/alltests.in --max-run=20
```

Compare the performance of SIMD extensions:

```bash
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest sse2     --test=10 --format=SHA512crypt
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx      --test=10 --format=SHA512crypt
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx2     --test=10 --format=SHA512crypt
 docker run ghcr.io/openwall/john:latest avx512bw --test=10 --format=SHA512crypt
```

The highlights:

- prince mode available;
- the rolling version of John 1.9.0 Jumbo 1+ (`ghcr.io/openwall/john:rolling`):
  - has auto-selection of the best SIMD if user specifies `best` as the `<binary id>`.

## Packages Checksums

> Released packages checksums computed by Build Servers

File verification is the process of using an algorithm for verifying the integrity
of a computer file. A popular approach is to store checksums (hashes) of files,
also known as message digests, for later comparison. All john packages checksums (hashes)
are computed by the CI servers.

By accessing the build logs for each release on GitHub releases you can view the hashes of all
relevant files.

## Security

Please inspect all packages prior to running any of them to ensure safety.
We already know they're safe, but you should verify the security and contents of any
binary from the internet you are not familiar with.

We take security very seriously.
