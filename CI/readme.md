# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

The usage of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery is a method to frequently deliver software to users by
introducing automation into the stages of application development.

## Testing

Using multiple providers, we've created a DevOps infrastructure. We are mostly interested in quality assurance, CI
(continuous integration), and CD (continuous delivery). To achieve this goal, our testing scheme builds and inspects the
source code of John the Ripper using:

### Operating Systems (OS)

- Microsoft Windows:
  - Windows Server 2016 Datacenter (10.0.14393 N/A Build 14393);

### Toolchains

- Compilers:
  - gcc 7.4 (Win 2016), gcc 8.5 (Rocky Linux Enterprise Linux 8);
  - gcc 11.4 (Ubuntu 22 with OpenCL SDK for Intel Processors);
  - gcc 12.4 (Win 2019/2022);
  - gcc 13.3 (Ubuntu 24, snap, fuzzing);
  - gcc 14.2 (Fedora 41, Ubuntu Dev), gcc 14.2 (Flatpak);
  - Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3);
  - FreeBSD clang version 19.1.7 (FreeBSD 13, FreeBSD 14, FreeBSD 15);
  - Solaris (GCC) 11.2.0.

### Testing and Commissioning

- Builds:

  - LE (Little Endian) and BE (Big Endian) builds;
  - ASAN (address sanitizer) and UBSAN (undefined behavior sanitizer);
  - Fuzzing (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing>);
  - Cygwin on Windows Server;
  - OpenCL on CPU using Intel, and POCL (<http://portablecl.org/>) runtimes;
  - OpenCL on GPU using Azure cloud (_work in progress_);
  - And a final assessment using ARMv8 (aarch64), PowerPC64 Little-Endian, RISC-V 64-bit, and IBM System z.

- Plans and future vision:
  - Develop a fully automated build and release pipeline using Azure DevOps Services to create the CI/CD pipeline and
    Azure Services for deploying to development/staging and production. See the
    [release workflow here](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/blob/main/CI/workflow.pdf);
  - Add support to ClusterFuzz (OSS-Fuzz);
  - Add support to static code quality analyzer.

## Obsolete Architectures

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We can no longer build and package for these environments:

- Any 32-bit build (e.g. i386, ARM v7, and powerpc);
- Windows 8 or older (64-bit);
- Windows Server 2012 or older (64-bit);
- Intel-based macOS;
- Older X86_64 CPUs (AVX required);

If you need such a build, use a previous stable or rolling release.
