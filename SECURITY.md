# Security Policy

Important notes:
* `john` isn't to be used on untrusted input and should be run with the lowest privileges necessary;
  * it is unrealistic to have zero bugs, it is a consequence of how many formats and different parsers it has.
* prefer sandboxed versions of packages (snap, flatpak or Docker) whenever you need "hardening";
* reminder:
  * the MPI library (not used by our packges) tends to open and listening ports, so it can expose itself,
    `john`, and the underlying system to direct network-based attacks as well.

## Supported Versions

The `john` community releases patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the version:

| Version | Supported          | Note                                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| upstream bleeding code | :heavy_check_mark: | Under development version  |
| rolling 15b3b7c        | :white_check_mark: | Most recent release        |
| jumbo 1                | :x: | Stable released version                   |
| < jumbo 1              | :x: | No longer maintained                      |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please just report issues in public right away:
* if you are worried about a package or its dependencies, create a bug report [here](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/issues);
* otherwise, at https://github.com/openwall/john/issues.

If the issue is confirmed, `john` community will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.

Please note that for security purposes all inputs are considered trusted by upstream `john`, and it should
be assumed that input can control the program in arbitrary ways. In cases where greater robustness is desired,
use the snap, the flatpak or the Docker version; you can also use the `--format` option to reduce parsing
of input files.

## When to report a vulnerability

When you think John The Ripper has a potential security vulnerability.

When you know of or suspect a potential vulnerability on another project that is used by `john`.
For example, in a packaged dependency.
