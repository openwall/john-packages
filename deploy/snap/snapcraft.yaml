title: John the Ripper CE Auditing Tool
summary: John the Ripper password security auditing and recovery tool
description: |
  [Openwall's](https://openwall.com/) John the Ripper (JtR) is a fast password cracker,
  currently available for many flavors of Unix and for Windows. Its primary
  purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash
  types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are
  Windows LM hashes, various macOS password hashes, as well as many
  non-hashes such as SSH private keys, encrypted filesystems such as macOS .dmg files
  and "sparse bundles", encrypted archives such as ZIP, RAR, and 7z,
  encrypted document files such as PDF and Microsoft Office's, plus lots of
  other hashes and ciphers.
