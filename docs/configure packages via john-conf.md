# Configuring packages via john.conf

Some John packages file systems are intentionally read-only. So, in order to adjust the `john` settings file `john.conf`, you will need to:

## Snap

You just have to think about how the upstream itself works:

1. you cannot use `john-local.conf` (at least I haven't found a way to use it since `john` doesn't have a built-in
   variable that points to your runtime `Private home`);
2. so, you must have a full `john.conf` in the snap (environment) proper HOME folder. It is `$HOME/snap/john-the-ripper`;

So let's see how it works using an example:

DO NOT REMOVE YOUR `john.pot` IF IT MATTERS TO YOU. Save it first, at least.

* It works the same whether you are using the edge channel or the stable channel.
```shell
$ cd ~

# Create some sample hashes
john --format=sha512crypt -list=format-tests | cut -f3 > ~/alltests.in

* Crack it using the "regular" packaged `john`
```bash
$ rm -f snap/john-the-ripper/current/.john/*.pot; john ~/alltests.in --max-run=10 --mask

## Docker

Create a suitable `$(pwd)/.john/john.conf` file in your 'host'.

```bash
$ cp YOUR-FILE/john.conf $(pwd)/.john/john.conf
```

Then connect the 'host' file system to the running container (linking the host current folder to `/home/JtR`).

You will need add the following option to the `docker run` command line:
```bash
-v "$(pwd)":/home/JtR
```

Example:
```bash
$ docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/JtR ghcr.io/openwall/john best -form=SHA512crypt --incrementa:digits /home/JtR/alltests.in --max-run=20
```
