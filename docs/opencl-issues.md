## Advices To Anyone Facing Opencl Windows Problems

### If `john` is not recognizing your GPU card:

- make sure all required GPU drivers are installed;
- restart your PC, if you have just installed the drivers;
- if the previous items do not apply or if the problem persists:
  - using the `detect-OpenCL.ps1` script contained in the docs folder:
    ```powershell
     # I downloaded and extracted "john" to C:\Users\Me\JtR.
     # Then, opened the `detect-OpenCL.ps1` script and copied the command I need to use;
     #   For security reasons, powershell script execution is disabled by default
     PS C:\Users\Me> cd .\JtR\

     PS C:\Users\Me\JtR> run\john --list=opencl-devices
     Error: No OpenCL-capable platforms were detected by the installed OpenCL driver.

  - replacing cygwin's OpenCL library `cygOpenCL-1.dll` in the `run` directory with `OpenCL.dll` installed
  in the `c:\Windows\System32` folder. Copy in the `OpenCL.dll`, and rename the copied file `cygOpenCL-1.dll`. Example:
    ```powershell
     # I downloaded and installed john in C:\Users\Me\JtR
     C:\Users\Me\JtR> run\john --list=opencl-devices
       Error: No OpenCL-capable platforms were detected by the installed OpenCL driver.
       Error: No OpenCL-capable devices were detected by the installed OpenCL driver.

     C:\Users\Me\JtR> run\john --test=5 --format=nt-opencl
     No OpenCL devices found

     # If you find too many OpenCL.dll files, try them all one at a time:
     # - copy, rename, test; copy another file, rename and ...
     C:\Users\Me\JtR> copy c:\Windows\System32\OpenCL.dll run\cygOpenCL-1.dll
         1 file(s) copied.

     C:\Users\Me\JtR> run\john --test=5 --format=nt-opencl

### OpenCL compilation erros:

  - if you get errors like `Error building kernel /run/opencl/cryptsha512_kernel_GPU.cl`
    try running john from the subdirectory `opencl` (e.g. from `JtR\run\opencl` run `..\john.exe`).
